# GraphLib
This is my own implementation of graphs and pathfinding

* [License](#license)

## Features
* **Graph:** data structure
* **Breadth First Search:** path finding algorithm
* **Dijkstras:** path finding algorithm

## Notes
* This is my own graph library i plan to use in my projects. I focused on simplicity and modularity, to be able to implement algorithms on top of it later.
* Currently I have implemented the graph datastructure and two path searching algorithms(BFS / Dijkstra)
* BFS is used for searching the shortest path ingoring weights
* Dijksta is used to search the shortest path for weighted graphs
